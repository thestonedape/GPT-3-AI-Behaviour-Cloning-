## GPT-3
The application is available in https://share.streamlit.io/tmgthb/gpt-3/main/gpt3.py and it should run without memory issues. The API calls are currently free until 18 USD for the next 3 months. Therefore, the application may not work, in case I ran out of free api calls. Apart, the API secret key may require manual update in the Streamlit console to the most recent one.

#Details about the GPT-3 used here:
* The GPT-3 used here is the currently most powerful "Davinci"-engine, which is as well the most costly one.
* The GPT-3 NLP task can be changed by updating the code regards the NLP task: "Completion.create". See the Open AI API developer reference.
